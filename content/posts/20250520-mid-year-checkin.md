Well, I think my actual "journaling" fell off sometime in April. I would have to go back and check exactly but I started to just do longer "catch up" days and those kept compounding. It defeated the whole point of the thing, which I think was something like "Write down things that happen that I think are neat." It was a lot more of me keeping tracks of things and I had done and very little with how I felt about that specific thing. 

I knew this would be an interative cycle. The important part being that I wanted to get better at writing things down in general. Making a list of the things you did and didn't do on a day wasn't what I had as the intention. That's OKAY! Failure was part of the plan. Every good plan allows for it. 

I mainly came back to write this out to do a couple of things - 1. Forgive myself for stopping the journal. It is okay me! 2. Update the hugo template and make sure everything worked. And 3. to put off doing something else that I should probably actually write about in my journal. 

Others Goings On: I'm a little behind on book reading for the year. I'm still reading Too Damn Much but it has been a _little_ less than I was thinking. I am also stuck reading much longer books. I want to close out some series that I started so that is the personal focus which also requires some specific head spaces to align. I've also started and finished some video games. Neat! I also have more outside housework than I care to admit to all trying to get done in about 3 weeks. 

The Podcast is still on haitus mostly because I think C and I are still extremely busy. We've talked about how we specifically want to address some things and what we were actually covering (and how we were covering it) and we haven't had the time or energy for either of us to attempt to solve that. Maybe we'll come back to it or I'll just keep paying for podcast hosting for something that doesn't exist. When is the right time do pull something like that down anyway?
