I wish I could remember exactly where I heard this, or maybe I am bastardizing something from Marie Kondo, but "a game" I started playing with my wife is to ask her what brought her joy that day before we go to sleep. I started updating my journal (when I remember) with this same prompt when I determined that I thought my journal was a little too list-like. I found I just really wanted to try something that was different than what I was attempting before. See if that made it stick better. 

So, now I ask her the question "what brought you joy today" and we talk about it. I think this is a neat little activity you could (and maybe you already do this) use to see how someone is doing. I wish I could remember where I heard this. If you did this too me and I just riffed off of that, well you got what you wanted and now I think about it. You win. 

I realized a couple things about myself and the ol' internal clockwork. I'm not always very curious about "people", whether that is how they are or how they are feeling, or them in general. I spend a lot of time focusing on the "things." Questions like "did you get that done" and "how is that home project coming along" and less on questions like "are you excited about this." I just assume, incorrectly, that everyone kinda works how my brain does. So, I've started antognizing my own brain and those that are immediately near me. 

It is a small change and I sometimes forget to do it. I should make a shitty little sticker or a phone thing or something that reminds me to "be curious about people" once a day. I mean, I am pretty good about doing my wordle and such. Getting my reading done. Etc. etc. 

Let me know how you remind yourself to get things done that don't involve getting your phone out? How did you successfully build a habit? Send me an email or text me or something. I'm curious.
