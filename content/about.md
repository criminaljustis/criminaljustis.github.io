Hello. You found my page. I am trying to get better at writing so, you will see content about video games, books, table top games, and IT thoughts as well. I wouldn't take it too seriously though. You can find me on social media.

I run this blog with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), utilizing a theme probably linked on the bottom, and am currently hosted on github pages. This was an experiment for me to mostly figure out github actions and is now a thing I am going to do for other reasons. You can find the relevant tech info on my github, linked where you see the Octocat.
